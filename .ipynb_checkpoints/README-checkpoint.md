cd 21F2000400_IITMBS_MLOPS_OPPE2
Install Requirements

text
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train Model

text
python src/model/train.py --data data/data-3.csv
GCP and Kubernetes Deployment
Build Docker Image

text
docker build -t gcr.io/<your-gcp-project-id>/heart-disease-api:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .
docker push gcr.io/<your-gcp-project-id>/heart-disease-api:latest
Create GCS Bucket (for model/data artifacts)

text
gsutil mb gs://<your-mlops-bucket>
gsutil cp models/model.pkl gs://<your-mlops-bucket>/models/
Deploy to GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)

text
# Create cluster if not done already
gcloud container clusters create ml-cluster --num-nodes=2 --zone=<your-zone>
gcloud container clusters get-credentials ml-cluster --zone=<your-zone>

# Deploy app and expose with LoadBalancer
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
Autoscaling

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is set with maxReplicas: 3 (see k8s/deployment.yaml).

Objective Implementations
Explainability: Feature Importance
Used SHAP to identify key predictors for heart disease.

Top contributing factors (per SHAP analysis):

cp (chest pain type), thalach (max heart rate), oldpeak, exang, age

See /explainability/shap_explanation.png and /fairlearn_analysis/fairness_report.md

Fairness: Sensitive Attribute gender (Fairlearn)
Model fairness across gender evaluated using Fairlearn.

Metrics: disparate impact, demographic parity difference.

Results and figures under /fairlearn_analysis/.

Dockerized Model API on GCP, k8s Autoscaling (max pod-3)
API framework: [Flask/FastAPI] for model inference (src/api/app.py)

Docker: Containerizes full API stack.

K8s: Deployment script with autoscaler in /k8s/

GCP: Hosted on Google Kubernetes Engine, model weights pulled from GCS at pod startup.

Per-Sample Prediction, Logging, Observability
API endpoint supports single-record /predict.

All requests/responses logged (see /logs/prediction_logs/).

100 synthetic samples generated and used for demo, saved at /random_samples/synthetic_100.csv.

Performance Monitoring & Timeout (wrk)
wrk used for high-load request testing (see /wrk/).

Scripts and reports: average latency, timeout error rates, and throughput tested under concurrent load.

Results documented in /wrk/wrk_report.md.

Input Drift Detection
Input data distribution shift measured using statistical comparison (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test/JSD) between train and generated prediction samples.

Drift analysis, metrics, and visuals are in /drift/drift_report.md.

Data Poisoning Attack
Simulated by interchanging positive and negative labels in a subset of the data.

Model performance (e.g., accuracy, ROC-AUC) compared before and after.

Results available in /poisoning/poisoned_performance_comparison.md.

How to Use the Model API
Predict via API
text
curl -X POST "<your-service-endpoint>/predict" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"age": 55, "gender": "male", ... }'
Example requests and OpenAPI schema are available in /src/api/.

Observability & Monitoring
All predictions and errors are timestamp-logged.

Key metrics (traffic, error rate, latency) viewable via GCP console (Stackdriver).

Logs stored in /logs/ and also sent to GCPâ€™s logging pipeline.

Performance & Input Drift Reports
See /wrk/, /drift/ subfolders for full markdown summaries, plots, and test methodology.

Data Artifacts
Training data: /data/data-3.csv

Synthetic eval data: /random_samples/synthetic_100.csv

Model artifact: /models/model.pkl (also uploaded to GCS)
