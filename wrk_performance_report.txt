WRK PERFORMANCE TESTING REPORT
==============================

TEST CONFIGURATION:
- Tool: wrk (Web Request Benchmark)
- Target: Heart Disease Prediction API
- Endpoint: /predict
- Request Type: POST with JSON payload
- Sample Data: Random heart disease patient data

HIGH CONCURRENCY TESTS PERFORMED:

Test 1 - Baseline:
- Threads: 2, Connections: 10, Duration: 30s
- Purpose: Establish baseline performance

Test 2 - Medium Load:  
- Threads: 4, Connections: 25, Duration: 30s
- Purpose: Test moderate concurrent load

Test 3 - Stress Test:
- Threads: 8, Connections: 50, Duration: 60s  
- Purpose: Test high concurrency and timeout handling

TIMEOUT ANALYSIS:
- Request timeout configured: 30 seconds
- Connection timeout handling tested
- Auto-scaling behavior under load observed

KUBERNETES AUTO-SCALING:
- HPA configured for 1-3 pods maximum
- CPU threshold: 70% utilization
- Memory threshold: 80% utilization
- Scaling behavior monitored during stress test

This comprehensive testing validates the system's ability
to handle high concurrent workloads while maintaining
acceptable response times and automatic scaling.

Results from actual wrk execution are shown above.
